I am Sangeetha James. My career started as a developer in Mainframe followed by Java applications, where I played different roles of Product Support Engineer, Business Analyst working for different organizations/clients. I really wanted to take a break in what I was doing and started investing in learning & sharpening my skills. I ended up learning Python and started into Data Analytics. I love observing data and finding any insights that I can get out of it. I'm also learning to become a Machine learning enthusiast and try to see what I can do with this learning... Best is yet to come
