title: 100days of DataProjects
---

Today marks the first day of a new & exciting stuff that I've committed to take on. From today I'm going to work on Data Projects for next 100 days. Every.Single.Day

This is kind of scary to me. But, I'm going to do it afraid. Last 1+years, I'm in the journey of learning Python, understanding machine learning algorithms and trying out different things. I've failed and I've succeded. I always believe that learning is never wasted.

Now, I want to go to a new level of learning in really planning, committing and doing data projects for 100days.

## Best is yet to come. ##
