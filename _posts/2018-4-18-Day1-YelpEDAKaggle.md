title: Day1: Yelp Dataset Kaggle- EDA, Wordcloud, Sentiment, NLP 
---
Last week I worked on Data Preparation and analysis of yelp dataset <https://www.yelp.co.uk/dataset/documentation/json>. It took way more time as the JSON columns had nested dictionaries. I will be documenting some tips on how I read those content and created the dataframe. But, I did learn a lot by searching in stackoverflow.com and google.

My analysis and EDA (to be continued) is available in github <https://github.com/sanjames/DataProjects/blob/master/Yelp%20Dataset-EDA-SJ.ipynb>

Kaggle had the csv format (though I dont find the data to be accurate) and my analysis is in <https://bit.ly/2HBvSJ9>
